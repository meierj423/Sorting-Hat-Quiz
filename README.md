## Description

We are a group of web developers who are currently living in Gryffindor’s house. As a part of Dumbledore’s Army, we’ve created a quiz to sort out who is worthy enough to be a part of our army so we can form allies and defeat Lord Voldemort together!

The user will be prompted to answers a series of quiz questions to find out which of the four Hogwarts houses they belong to and who they will be living with!
